I was invited to develop a research project in partnership with the UK police, funded by the N8 research group, in order to investigate the issue of rising demand, and how information management may play a role. 

## Absract
This study explores the relationship between information culture and increasing demand within
the policing sector. By surveying police staff, their information culture profile is measured and
analysed. It is found to be highly varied amongst individuals, suggesting a lack of cultural cohesion
in the behaviours, values and norms of information use. The results suggest that defining and
developing an optimum information culture is the best approach for tackling demand.
